My name is Richard Weiss, and I work as Lead Data Consultant at Skyfii, in Sydney, Australia.

Skyfii is a market leader in WiFi and retail analytics, and we work with large retail clients to develop their data capabilities.
Our particular focus is extending the sorts of analytics that _online_ properties take for granted to _physical_ retailers.
I also work with clients to develop general data capabilities and help them to apply data science to real-world problems.

Feel free to reach out to me at [richardweiss@richardweiss.org](mailto:richardweiss@richardweiss.org) if you'd like to chat.
Particularly if you're interested in:

 - Anything I post here
 - Building the _human_ side of data science, and integrating it into organizations
 - If you've got a burning analytical question that needs answering.
