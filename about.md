My actual name is Richard Weiss. RiRi is just the nickname I've been using pretty much everywhere, forever. 

I'll keep this brief:

* I'm lead data scientist at Skyfii, a company that provides analytics for the real world, to help improve marketing and operation. I oversee large, sophisticated data projects for clients focusing on:
  * Data strategy & architecture
  * Generating insights through sophisticated statistical and big-data techniques,
  * Guiding clients with data-driven insights 
* At the moment, I'm interested in
  * Deep learning
  * Probabilistic programming
  * Embedded development
* I'm also a casual acrobat, when I'm not doing data things.
